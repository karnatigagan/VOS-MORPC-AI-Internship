During the year 1872, no general Indian war took place in the Divi 
sion, but the number of murders and. depredations committed by small 
war parties in various places was greater than during the preceding year. 
The line of frontier settlements had steadily advanced during the year, 
especially in Kansas, Nebraska, Minnesota and Dakota, gradually absorb 
ing the country which only a year or two before was in the possession of 
the Indians, and the trans-continental railway lines were progressing 
rapidly westward through the Division. The Northern Pacific Railroad 
had reached the Missouri River about the close of the year, the actual 
surveys and locations for the roadway being made as far west as the 
mouth of the Powder River, two hundred miles beyond the Missouri. 
The Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway was extended as far west 
as Fort Dodge, Kansas, in its progress up the valley of the Arkansas, 
while surveying parties for the Southern Pacific Railway were engaged 
in locating the line of that road in both directions from the vicinity of 
El Paso. For the protection of the surveyors and the construction par 
ties upon all these lines, a considerable force of troops was necessary as 
escorts, and minor engagements between Indians and these small detach 
ments were of repeated occurrence. The guarding of the Rio Grande 
frontier against the incursions of border thieves consisting of Mexicans, 
half-breeds and Indians, also furnished occasion for considerable activity 
on the part of the troops in that portion of the Division, involving con 
stant watchfulness and much patient endurance.
