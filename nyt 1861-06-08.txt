WASHINGTON, Friday, June 7, 1861
The rumors since Saturday last of the march of Federal-troops upon Fairfax Court-house were without foundation. No changes have been made, excepting in the position of regiments on the defensive works in course of construction. The troops labor hard during the day and sleep soundly at night, disturbed only by an occasional exchange of shots between their guards and the Virginia scouts. Furthest in advance is a force of several companies of the Second Cavalry, the senior officer of which is the gallant Capt. BRACKETT, who has seen much service and established a high character for vigilance.
Five companies of the Third United States Infantry, namely: Company B, Capt. SHEPHERD; Company D. Lieut. BELL commanding; Company G. Lieut. WILLIAMS commanding; Company H, Capt. SHERIDAN; and Company K, Capt. SYKES, accompanied by a band numbering twenty pieces, with eleven heavily loaded baggage-wagons, left the barracks in the Fourth Ward at 4 o'clock this afternoon, and marched to the railroad station, where they took passage, so the men said, for Chambersburgh.
This movement, in connection with the concentration of troops at that point, is regarded as indicative of immediate designs by the Government with reference to the stronghold of the enemy at Harper's Ferry.
