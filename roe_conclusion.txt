CONCLUSION, 
In connection with the operations of the Army, within the Military 
Division of the Missouri, many important changes have taken place dur 
ing the fifteen years embraced by the foregoing narrative; much of the 
country which, at the beginning of that period, was monopolized by the 
buffalo and the Indian, has now been opened to the settler, to the rail 
road and to civilization. With a loss to the troops of more than a 
thousand officers and men killed and wounded, and partly as the result 
of more than four hundred skirmishes, combats and battles, — not includ 
ing many pursuits and surrenders of Indians, when no actual fighting 
occurred, — the majority of the wasteful and hostile occupants of millions 
of acres of valuable agricultural, pasture and mineral lands, have been 
forced upon reservations under the supervision of the Government; some 
have been gradually taught a few of the simpler useful industries, 
Indian children have been placed in schools, under instruction in a bet 
ter life than the vagabond existence to which they were born, and the 
vast section over which the wild and irresponsible tribes once wandered, 
redeemed from idle waste to become a home for millions of progressive 
people. 

Following behind the advancing troops who protected the hardy 
pioneer engaged in breaking the soil for his homestead, came the Kansas 
and Union Pacific railways, racing through Kansas and Nebraska, to 
gain " the hundreth meridian." Guarded by the soldiers, the surveying 
and construction parties completed the main lines of those roads during 
the earlier years covered by this narrative, and later their branches and 
connections have extended into many fertile valleys which now support 
not only a thick local population, but supply, also, material for the bread 
of this Nation and the old world. Subsequently the Atchison, Topeka 
and Santa Fe railway opened to the stock raisers, the rich cattle ranges 
of the Arkansas Valley, and carried into the drowsy regions of New 
Mexico, the implements of a new era. Across Dakota and Montana, to 
day, the working parties of the Northern Pacific, escorted by the troops, 
are rapidly adding another complete trans-continental highway, and over 
all of the foregoing roads are pouring thousands of cars loaded with 
cattle, to furnish eastern markets with their daily supply of beef. With 
its narrow iron threadways, the Denver and Rio Grande has seamed the 
almost vertical faces of mountain cliffs, scaled their lofty summits and 
made available the wealth of Utah and Colorado. Through the State of 
Texas, the Southern Pacific, the Texas Pacific, and the International and 
Great Northern, have opened complete routes to the Pacific and into Old 
Mexico, whilst all over the Division, numerous minor roads and branches 
are constantly penetrating what were, until recently, mysterious and 
almost unknown regions. 

As the railroads overtook the successive lines of isolated frontier 
posts, and settlements spread out over country no longer requiring mili 
tary protection, the army vacated its temporary shelters and marched on 
into remote regions beyond, there to repeat and continue its pioneer 
work. In rear of the advancing line of troops, the primitive " dug-outs " 
and cabins of the frontiersmen, were steadily replaced by the tasteful 
houses, thrifty farms, neat villages and busy towns of a people who 
knew how best to employ the vast resources of the great West. The 
civilization from the Atlantic is now reaching out toward that rapidly 
approaching it from the direction of the Pacific, the long intervening 
strip of territory, extending from the British Possessions to Old Mexico, 
yearly growing narrower; finally the dividing lines will entirely disap 
pear and the mingling settlements absorb the remnants of the once pow 
erful Indian nations who, fifteen years ago, vainly attempted to forbid 
the destined progress of the age.
