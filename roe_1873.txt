1873.
During the year 1873, the depredations of raiding parties of Mexican 
thieves, Indians and half-breeds in the vicinity of the Rio Grande con 
tinued, as did also the attacks by Indians upon the military posts and 
field escort detachments guarding the surveying and construction parties 
engaged upon the lines of railway.

attacked a band of Mexican thieves about seven miles south east of Fort 
Sill, Indian Territory, and recaptured thirty-six horses.

coln, Dakota, (previously known as Fort McKeen,) garrisoned by
