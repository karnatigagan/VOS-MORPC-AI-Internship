I think the terrorism now existing in Louisiana, Mississippi and Arkansas could be entirely removed and confidence and fair dealing established, by the arrest and trial of the ringleaders of the armed White Leagues. If Congress would pass a bill declaring them banditti, they could be tried by a military commission. The leaders of the banditti who murdered men here on the 14th of last September, also more recently at Vicksburg, Mississippi, should in justice to law and order, and the peace and prosperity of this southern part of the country, be punished. It is possible that if the President would issue a proclamation declaring them banditti, no further action would need be taken, except that which would devolve upon me. P. H. Sheridan, Lieutenant-General United States Army. January 5th, 1875
