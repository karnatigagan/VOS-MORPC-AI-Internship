Historical General Sheridan LLM for internship LLaMA With LangChain Integration

The General Sheridan Project is a complex AI and historical simulation tool designed to create interactive experiences with historical figures like General Philip Sheridan. The project focuses on running and fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) like LLaMA to generate text-based interactions that reflect the personality and historical knowledge of the character. 

historical simulation tool designed around AI-powered interaction, utilizing cutting-edge language models (LLaMA 3) fine-tuned to simulate complex historical characters. The project blends NLP, web development, ethical considerations, and historical research, with future aspirations of expanding to other communities and improving the technical foundation. The main challenges revolve around fine-tuning the models for a nuanced and accurate portrayal of historical figures and handling the computational demands of running large language models.

- Will be using M3 Max Macbook Pro to run this project.
